## Summary:
After accumulating five years of in-depth experience in Quality Assurance (QA) Automation Engineer, I have decided to transition to a role as a Front End Engineer. This decision is driven by my evolving career aspirations, a keen interest in front-end development, and the desire to leverage my existing skills in a new and challenging domain.

I am eager to tackle new challenges and expand my expertise in modern front-end frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. Embracing this transition will allow me to diversify my skill set, contribute holistically to the software development process, from initial design to final implementation, and bring a unique perspective to the team, bridging the gap between development and quality assurance.

I am motivated by a passion for front-end technologies and the applicability of my existing skills and I am confident that this transition will significantly enhance my professional journey.

## Code Example:
**Find The Duplicated Number in a Consecutive Unsorted List - Tougher Version from CODEWARS:**

Spin-off of this kata, here you will have to figure out an efficient strategy to solve the problem of finding the sole duplicate number among an unsorted array/list of numbers starting from 1 up to n. Hints: a solution in linear time can be found; using the most intuitive ones to search for duplicates that can run in O(n²) time won't work.
```javascript
const findDup = arr => arr.find((el, i) => i !== arr.lastIndexOf(el));
```
